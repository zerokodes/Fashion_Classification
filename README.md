In this session, we worked with multiclass image classification with deep learning. The deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras was  implemented on clothing dataset to classify images of t-shirts.

The dataset has 5000 images of 20 different classes, however, we'll be using the subset which contains 10 of the most popular classes.
